            "A writer is the sum of his experiences"<br>
            <br>

            if you don’t wander out into the field covered in tinfoil and armed with an old tv antenna."<br>

        <h2>Writer, Developer, Gamer</h2>
 
        <p class="main">
            No one knows what the meaning of life is, but to me life is what you make it.<br> 
            And the best way to make the most out of life is to find your passion, and do what makes you happy.<br>
            For me, my passion is storytelling. I want to share my thoughts, perspectives, ideas, and experiences with the world through stories. I want to write short stories, animation, graphic novels, and hopefully one day even video games.
